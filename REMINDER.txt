we were in line number 241 of the create.jsx page
we added multiple hash workers for the hashes
we also figured out how to save the data and get it using gun
lexical keyword match in get and search limitations also learnt
thus also figuring out the infinite scrolling mechanism
also converted the gun get and put methods into promises from callbacks and put them into gunHandlers.js inside the utility folder
the gun upload and getting reference is available in the final folder within the blog folder in the gun js folder.
we already uploaded the length and the author of the image in gun js

only two final things left: 
1. serial upload of all the chunks into the respective hases.
2. in the feed page, display the uploaded images:
    2.a. get the uploaded image hashes, get the author and the lengths
    2.b. combine all the chunks and return as a single image and display it in the feed page

--- update 
image being returned correctly but the hashes are different each

!!-- Save bio feature is not working for the newly created workers.. debug it.. maybe some problems with the password storage
!!-- in profile page, the features are not added into the user space... look into it and if needed do some debugging
